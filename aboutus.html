      <h2>Welcome to Fireward Courses</h2>
      <p>
        Fireward Courses was created to help anyone—no matter their age or background—learn new skills with confidence. 
        Whether you're exploring JavaScript for the first time or diving into advanced projects, each lesson is designed to be hands-on, visual, and easy to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every course includes interactive challenges, quizzes, and projects that help reinforce what you’ve learned. 
        The goal is simple: make learning feel less like homework and more like play.

    <section class="about-mission">
      <h2>My Mission</h2>
      <p>
        My mission is to make education **free, fun, and frustration-free**. 
        Fireward Courses strives to transform the way people see learning — not as something you “have to” do, but something you *want* to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        By combining humor, real projects, and a clear step-by-step structure, I want to show that anyone can learn to code or understand science concepts without feeling overwhelmed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-values">
      <h2>What I Believe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Education is crucial — but it doesn’t have to be boring.</li>
        <li>It’s never too late to learn something new or start a project that excites you.</li>
        <li>Young people can build amazing things when given the tools and confidence.</li>
        <li>Small steps every day lead to real progress and mastery.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
      <div class="team-member">
        <h3>Ben</h3>
        <p>
          Ben is a teen web developer passionate about coding, chemistry, and education reform. 
          He believes that traditional teaching methods often make learning feel lifeless — and he’s here to change that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through Fireward Courses, Ben hopes to create a space where learners of all ages can grow, laugh, and achieve their goals — 
          all while discovering the fun side of coding and science.
