  <h1>Big mistakes new JavaScript developers make (and how you can fix them)</h1>

  <p>It is a well-known fact that JavaScript is a programming language that is in rather high demand in the software industry, but its complex nature and steep learning curve make it hard to know where to start. When you eventually figure out where to start (our JavaScript beginner course is a good option to consider), you learn for a bit, and once you know enough of the basics, you begin following the 80/20 rule, which advises you to spend 80% of your time coding and not just looking for help on Stack Overflow. We know how that feels, and that’s why this blog post exists. Now, without further ado, let’s get into the biggest mistakes you may encounter on your JavaScript journey, and how to avoid them altogether.</p>

  <h2>Mistake #1: Ignoring the 80/20 rule</h2>
  <p>The 80/20 rule works in many fields in different ways. In general, it just shows a 4:1 ratio between two things that lead to the most favorable outcome. For example, in business, 20% of customers can generate 80% of your income, which tells you which customers to focus on.</p>
  <p>In our case, it’s about focusing on practicing and muscle memory over taking in new information past the basics. So, how does this relate to mistakes in coding? Well, not following it can be one of the biggest mistakes any new programmer can make. Focusing too little on using the skills you learned can raise suspicion about why you would learn them in the first place. You learned to code to be able to code, not just to recall facts about it from memory!</p>
  <p>It has been tested, and any other ratio results in not getting the desired outcome, which is becoming a good web developer who is proficient in the coding language of JavaScript. That is the beauty of the 80/20 rule.</p>

  <h2>Mistake #2: The Copy-Paste Trap</h2>
  <p>Stack Overflow, GitHub, and AI tools can be a blessing… or a curse. It’s tempting to grab a snippet of code, paste it into your project, and cheer when it works. But the problem is, if you don’t understand why it works, you won't know how to fix any errors that may pop up. Imagine how long you'll spend refining code that you could have just written yourself.</p>
  <p>Instead, always make sure you understand before copying and pasting, or you might end up with a lot of bugs that'll take forever to fix.</p>

  <h2>Mistake #3: Skipping the Basics</h2>
  <p>There aren't many developers who've never dreamed of making the next viral bit of tech. However, assuming you can do that even when you've skipped over some fundamental concepts? Think again! Everyone has to start somewhere, and even the biggest names in tech today most likely started with the basics of coding.</p>
  <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Balance is crucial. Learn the basics before considering yourself ready to contribute to the massive network known as the internet.</p>

  <h2>Wrapping It Up</h2>
  <p>Becoming great at JavaScript isn’t about memorizing syntax or hoarding tutorial playlists—it’s about building, breaking, and fixing real projects. Follow the 80/20 rule, avoid copy-pasting without knowing what the code means first, and even revisit the basics multiple times if you have to. Do that, and you’ll be on the fast track from beginner to confident developer.</p>
  <p>If you ever feel stuck on this topic, just remember that you've got to start somewhere, and mistakes are part of the journey to anything, no matter how wrong it feels and how much you want to question it. Now, get out there, the world needs more coding!</p>
