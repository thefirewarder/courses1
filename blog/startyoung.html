  <h1>Starting Young: The Benefits of Beginning Web Development, All Before You Turn 18</h1>

  <p>You may or may not have realized from any marketing or content that led up to you reading this blog that I am running this site as a teenager. Whenever people talk about the future of tech and the internet, some names come to mind: Bill Gates, Sundar Pichai, and more. While these people might have some of the most brilliant instruments of technology at their fingertips, the true future of anything is the younger generation. Now, with all of the drama and videos about the current younger generation, you have to realize that they are your next doctors, your next lawyers, your next teachers, and even your next janitors. Everyone in my generation will most likely grow up to fulfill a job in the modern society we know and may or may not love. And yes, the internet will eventually be in the hands of the developers of Generation Z, Generation Alpha, and Generation Beta. While it may seem daunting, the goal of this blog post is not to worry about or applaud what might happen to society when the newest generations grow up and take their rightful places in the job market. The goal of this blog post is to explain WHY you should start young and not wait for a high school diploma or bachelor’s degree.</p>

  <h2>Reason 1: Get a Head Start</h2>
  <p>Not everyone is up to the challenge of web development, and even the ones who are interested might put it off until they finish their education. But why start later, when you can start while your brain is youngest and has the most creative ideas? That is a question that many do not ever want to answer, as they would rather just grow up and join the rat race of work at the same time as everyone else, without gaining an easy but fair advantage. But while this is the safer option, it looks worse on a resumé or a website explaining your expertise. It’s like when a restaurant name hints at it being there “since 1894” versus another restaurant that says “since 2025”. This may not even be the best example, as credibility and first impressions matter even more online and in the job industry. So, getting a head start is one of the best things you can do for yourself and your career.</p>

  <h2>Reason 2: Escape the Matrix</h2>
  <p>Have you ever wanted to start your own business? I sure have. It started as a lemonade stand and gradually turned into a course website, with many steps in between. The only way to truly become a self-made multi-millionaire or billionaire is to start your own business, and you can’t always count on inheritance or getting married to someone with incredibly deep pockets. So, unless you want to be capped out at about $400,000 as a surgeon, which, don’t get me wrong, is a great salary, you should start a business and “escape the matrix.” One of the best ways to do this is e-products, like my courses, as it is lower risk than dropshipping or any other sales methods that could otherwise be deemed “risky”. So, starting a business is another great tip, as shown by the reasons above.</p>

  <h2>Reason 3: It Helps You Think Creatively</h2>
  <p>Web development is good for you! It boosts your creativity and sets you up for greatness! By coding, you are learning a new skill that is paid very well from an employee standpoint and even better if you make your own content! Because of that, coding is a great career path and something you should start, or keep doing, regardless of your age.</p>
